### Write Image to the microSD Card

Intructions available for different operative systems (OS).

_It might take more than 10 minutes to write the image to the microSD card, take a break and come back later._

### Setup and First Boot

[Setup and First Boot](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit#setup)

### SSH Connection

***Using USB cable***

1. Connect the Jetson Nano to your computer via USB
2. Connect via SSH: `ssh nvidia@192.168.55.1`

The ip address `192.168.55.1` is by default the port for SSH connections via USB; for wireless connection, it is necesary to verify the wlan address asigned to the Jetson Nano.

`ifconfig`

Look for he IP address with the tag `inet` related to your connection

Ouput example:

`wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet XXX.X.XX  netmask XXX.XXX.XXX.X  broadcast XXX.XXX.X.XXX
        inet6 ...<`

***From another computer in the same network:***

`ifconfig`

Look for he IP address with the tag `inet` related to your connection

Ouput example:

`wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet XXX.X.XX  netmask XXX.XXX.XXX.X  broadcast XXX.XXX.X.XXX
        inet6 ...<`

Finally, you can connect remotely:

`ssh <your_user_name>@<your_ip_address>`

For example:

`ssh <name_of_your_jetson_nano>@192.168.1.16`

- **From another computer on a different network:**

***TBD***


### Virtual Network Computing

_VNC (Virtual Network Computing) enables you to control your Jetson developer kit from another computer on the same network, by viewing and interacting with the desktop of the developer kit from the other computer._

In a few works, you can get remote access to your Jetson nano

## Jetson AI Fundamentals Course

You can enroll on the Nvidia Deep Learning institute to follow the course:

- [Enroll in course](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-RX-02+V2/about)

The system will ask you to create an Nvidia developer account and after signing in with your credentials you will have access to the course and tutorials to run several containers on your Jetson. 

***Getting to know the JetPack version of your hardware is important to install the right container:***

`dpkg-query --show nvidia-l4t-core`

Output example:

`nvidia-l4t-core	32.5.1-20210219084526`

This information is relevant to select the <tag> corresponding to the Docker container you need to run.

For example:

`docker run --runtime nvidia -it --rm --network host     --volume ~/nvdli-data:/nvdli-nano/data     --device /dev/video0     nvcr.io/nvidia/dli/dli-nano-ai:v2.0.1-r32.5.0`

_Note the `<tag>` `v2.0.1-r32.5.0` makes reference to the core version running on the Jetson._
